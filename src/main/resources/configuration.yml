# CONFIGURATION FILE FOR RANKGRANT+ BY DEMENG7215 #
# This is where you can customize the functions of RankGrant+. #
# Everything in this file should be clearly explained. For questions, use the support options. #
# NOTE: Some rank-related configuration options are in the "ranks.yml" file.
# Below is the configuration example/explanation, followed by the actual configuration. #
# |
# Do not edit this value.
# config-version: 1
# |
# Should RankGrant+ log all grants in the "log.txt" file?
# This value can be either "true" or "false".
# log-grants: true
# |
# The commands that will be executed on grant and ungrant.
# Specific BASED ON YOUR PERMISSIONS PLUGIN.
# You can use the %target% and %rank% placeholders.
# commands:
#  grant:
#    - "none"
#  ungrant:
#    - "none"

# The sizes of the rank selection GUI and the reason selection GUI.
# MUST be a multiple of nine and 54 or under.
# gui-size:
#  ranks: 54
#  reasons: 54
# |
# The reasons of grant that will be listed in the reason selection GUI.
# To create a new reason, start a new configuration section under "reasons".
# You can use %target% for the name of the player who is receiving the rank, %rank% for the rank name,
# %duration% for the duration of the grant, and %reason% for the reason (shouldn't really be needed).
# slot = the slot number in the GUI, 1 being the first slot

# This is a long one. This customize every single button in the duration-choosing GUI. Do not add new configuration sections.
# duration-format customizes the format of the duration text.
# The %duration% placeholders in later configurations will be replaced with this text.
# In duration-format, you can use %weeks%, %days%, %hours%, %minutes%, and %seconds%
# for the number of weeks, days, hours, minutes and minutes.
# You can use the %target% placeholder for the person who is receiving the rank in all configurations after the
# duration-format configuration. You can also use %rank% for the display name of the rank that the target is receiving.
# In word-permanent, simply fill out the word that you want %duration% to be replaced with if the grant is permanent.
